vlan -----a virtual lan is any broadcast  domain  that is partitioned and isolated in a computer network at the data link layer..in virtual lan we grouped the network nodes on logical basis rather than physical basis

STP===spanning tree protocol is link management protocol which provides path redundancey while protecting network from
loops

switches running spaning-tree protocol exchanges information with a special message called the BPDU
Bridge protocol data unit 
Information in BPDU is needed to creat and maintain  the spanning tree protocol 
in bpdu ----
	protocol identifier 
	protocol version identifier
	BPDU type
	flags 
	Root identfier 
	Root path cost
	Bridge identifier
	message age
 	max age
	Hello time 
	forward delay
