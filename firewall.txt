a firewall is concept which can be implemented by a software or hardware or both software and hardware ,it enforces the access control policy in multile security domain 
objective of a good firewall


1 	it must be resistant to attacks
2 	traffic between newtworks must be forced through firewall
3	the firewall enforces the access control policy of the organiztion

firewall reduces the risk of ----
	1	exposures of senstive system to untrusted individuals
	2	Exploitation of protocol flaws
	3 	unauthorized users
	4 	Malicious data

limitation of firewall
	1	configuration mistakes have serious consequences
	2	Not all network application were written to survive going thorough the firewall
	3	Individual who are forced to go through firewall might try to engineer a way around it
	4	Latency being added by the firewall



firewall design considerations
	1 firewall should be placed at security boundaries such as between two network have different level of trust(fro		prosepective of your organization )
	2  firewall should be primary security device ,but not only securty device or security measure on the network
	3  create a policy which by default deny all traffic
	4 

firwall access rule
		
	appropriate method for implementing firewall is based on a policy.The policy drives what the firewall configuration should do
	

	rule based on service control
	rule based on address control
	rule based on direction control
	rule based on user control
	rule based on behaviour control




methedology of firewall
			1-static packet filtering
			2-proxy firewall (application layer gateway)
			3-stateful packet filtering
			4-NAT
			5-tranparent firewall
			6-Next generation context and application-aware firewalls
		







stateful vs packet filtering firewall 
			----stateful firewall is aware of the connections and traffic that passes through it....
			   in the other hand packet filtering firewalls don't look at the connection but just at the packet themselve




Sequence number randomization
	tcp/ip protcol stack used fairly predictible methods when using the sequence number :
