A large part of being a system administrator is collecting accurate information about your server and infrastructure .
There are number of tools available for gathering and processing this type of information .Many of them are built upon a techenology called SNMP




SNMP stands for simple network management protocol .it is a way that server can share information  about thier current
state and also a channel through which an administrator can modify pre-defined value.while the protocol itself is very simple,the structure of program that implement SNMP CAN be very complex


An snmp agent is a program  that can gather information about a piece of hardware organize it into predefined entries 
and respond to querie using snmp protocol

the component of this model that queries agent for information  is called SNMP manager these machines generally have data about all of the snmp-enabled devices in their network and can issues a request to gather information and set certain properties


HOw it works
	GET- USED to request information from the agent
	SET - used to change devices confi
	traps - sent from agent to the manager to inform about a condition send without acknowledgment
	inform - same as trps except that the manager needs to acknowledge reciept,if acknowledgement isn't 
		 recieved the another inform will be sent
